//! Execution Pipeline Orchestrator (RFC 0029)
//!
//! The `ExecutionPipeline` composes all four stages into a single execution flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! ResolveRequest → ResolveStage → ExecutionPlan
//!                                      ↓
//!                  EnsureStage  → ExecutionPlan (installed)
//!                                      ↓
//!                  PrepareStage → PreparedExecution
//!                                      ↓
//!                  ExecuteStage → i32 (exit code)
//! ```
//!
//! The pipeline is the primary entry point for executing runtimes.
//! In Phase 1, it exists alongside the monolithic `Executor::execute_with_with_deps`.
//! In later phases, the executor will delegate to this pipeline.
