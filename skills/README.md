# vx — AI Agent Skills

This directory contains AI agent skills for **[vx](https://github.com/loonghao/vx)** — the universal development tool manager (v0.8.25).

> **Core concept**: vx = prefix any dev tool command with `vx` → it auto-installs the tool and runs it.

These skills are the **single source of truth** shared across:
- `vx ai setup` — embeds skills into the vx binary at compile time, distributes to 17+ AI agents
- **ClawHub** — published automatically via CI when changes merge to main
- **Agent config directories** — `.codebuddy/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, etc.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Size | Best for |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| **vx-usage** | Core usage guide — commands, vx.toml, providers, GitHub Actions, MCP integration | ~15 KB | First-time users, general questions |
| **vx-commands** | CLI command reference — all flags, output formats (`--json`, `--format toon`) | ~6 KB | Looking up specific command syntax |
| **vx-project** | Project management — init, sync, setup, vx.toml configuration, monorepo | ~6 KB | Setting up or configuring projects |
| **vx-best-practices** | Best practices — version strategy, cross-platform, security, provider development | ~10 KB | Team workflows, provider creation |
| **vx-troubleshooting** | Troubleshooting — installation failures, PATH issues, diagnostics, recovery | ~8 KB | Fixing errors, diagnosing issues |

## Install

```bash
# Via vx (distributes to all AI agents)
vx ai setup

# Via ClawHub CLI
clawhub install loonghao/vx

# Or copy skills/ directory to your AI agent's skills directory
```

## CI Publishing to ClawHub

The repository publishes `skills/` to ClawHub through `.github/workflows/sync-skills.yml`.

- Pushes to `main` that modify `skills/**` trigger an automatic publish
- Maintainers can also trigger the workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch`
- The repository secret `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` must be configured for the publish to succeed
- Failed ClawHub publishes are treated as workflow failures so main-branch sync issues are visible immediately

## When Skills Activate

The skills trigger when:
- The project contains `vx.toml` or `.vx/` directory
- The user mentions `vx`, tool version management, or cross-platform setup
- The user needs to manage development tool versions


### Skill Routing Guide

Use this decision tree to pick the right skill:

```
User's question:
├─ "How do I use vx?" / general usage
│  → vx-usage
├─ "What's the command for...?" / specific flag or syntax
│  → vx-commands
├─ "Set up my project" / vx.toml / monorepo
│  → vx-project
├─ "Best way to..." / team workflow / provider development
│  → vx-best-practices
├─ "Error: ..." / "not working" / "failed"
│  → vx-troubleshooting
├─ "MCP integration" / "GitHub Actions"
│  → vx-usage (has dedicated sections)
└─ "Add a new tool to vx"
   → vx-best-practices (provider development section)
```
